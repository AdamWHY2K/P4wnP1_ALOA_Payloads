# Directory_Dacoity

Author: AdamWHY2K

# Description
This script is intended to exfiltrate the layout of important directories (Documents, Pictures, Videos, etc. The exact directories can be changed.)
This is my first project of this kind, I encourage critisism and ideas.

## Config

* Enable HID Keyboard and USB Mass Storage under USB SETTINGS.
* Copy **Directory_Dacoity.js** to ```/usr/local/P4wnP1/HIDScripts/```.
* Create a trigger than executes "Directory_Dacoity.js" when USB gadget connected to host.
