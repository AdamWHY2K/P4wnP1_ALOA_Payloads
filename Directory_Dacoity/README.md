Author: AdamWHY2K

# Description
This script is intended to exfiltrate the layout of important directories, the exact directories can be changed.

Directories it will exfiltrate by default: Documents, Pictures, Videos, Downloads, Recycle Bin.

This is my first project of this kind, I encourage criticism and ideas.
